This is the code artefact to run experiments conducted in the Jupyter Notebooks.

# Python Environment Setup.

To setup a python environment follow the steps below:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requriements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can use conda to setup the environment.

```bash
conda create --name venv python=3.9
conda activate venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Please use google colab to access Deep Learning Experiments since it uses GPU to train Deep Learning models.
